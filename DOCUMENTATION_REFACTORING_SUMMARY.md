# Documentation Refactoring Summary

## Overview

The repository documentation has been completely refactored to reflect the current state of the codebase, which has evolved through three major approaches:

1. **Video-Only** (Original) - Basic 3D CNN
2. **Multimodal** - Visual + DeepLabCut pose features
3. **Multi-Task** (Advanced) - State-of-the-art with VideoMAE2/ViT, TCN, pose graphs

## Current Documentation Structure

### Core Documentation (Keep & Use)

| File | Purpose | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| **README.md** | Main entry point, all approaches | ✅ Updated |

## Next Steps (Optional)

### Option 1: Archive Old Technical Docs

Create an `archive/` directory and move the consolidated files:

```bash
mkdir archive
mv CLIP_LENGTH_FIX.md archive/
mv DATA_STATISTICS_EXPLANATION.md archive/
mv FIXES_SUMMARY.md archive/
mv GRADIENT_TRACKING_FIX.md archive/
mv MULTITASK_IMPROVEMENTS.md archive/
mv MULTITASK_TRAINING_FIXED.md archive/
mv MULTI_GPU_TRAINING.md archive/
mv MULTI_TRIAL_UPDATE.md archive/
mv POSE_GRAPH_AND_MODEL_TYPES.md archive/
mv SKIPPING_INVALID_TRIALS.md archive/
mv TORCH_UINT8_FIX.md archive/
mv TQDM_PROGRESS_BARS.md archive/
mv VARIABLE_TRIAL_LENGTHS.md archive/
mv VIDEOMAE_HUGGINGFACE_UPDATE.md archive/
mv WANDB_LOGGING.md archive/
```

### Option 2: Delete Old Technical Docs

If you're confident you don't need them (all info is in CHANGELOG.md):

```bash
rm CLIP_LENGTH_FIX.md
rm DATA_STATISTICS_EXPLANATION.md
rm FIXES_SUMMARY.md
rm GRADIENT_TRACKING_FIX.md
rm MULTITASK_IMPROVEMENTS.md
rm MULTITASK_TRAINING_FIXED.md
rm MULTI_GPU_TRAINING.md
rm MULTI_TRIAL_UPDATE.md
rm POSE_GRAPH_AND_MODEL_TYPES.md
rm SKIPPING_INVALID_TRIALS.md
rm TORCH_UINT8_FIX.md
rm TQDM_PROGRESS_BARS.md
rm VARIABLE_TRIAL_LENGTHS.md
rm VIDEOMAE_HUGGINGFACE_UPDATE.md
rm WANDB_LOGGING.md
```

### Option 3: Update SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md

**Current state**: SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md only shows video-only architecture

**Could be updated to include**:
- All three approach architectures side-by-side
- Flowchart showing when to use each
- More detailed multi-task architecture diagram

**This is optional** - the current state is functional, just not comprehensive.

### Option 4: Update IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md

**Current state**: IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md focuses on video-only approach

**Could be updated to include**:
- Design rationale for multimodal approach
- Why multi-task learning helps
- Trade-offs between approaches

**This is optional** - information is scattered in other docs.

## Documentation Quality Improvements

### Before Refactoring

- ❌ 22 markdown files, confusing organization
- ❌ No clear entry point
- ❌ Multi-task approach poorly documented
- ❌ Technical fixes scattered across 15 files
- ❌ No comparison between approaches
- ❌ Unclear which files are current vs. archived

### After Refactoring

- ✅ 10 core documentation files, clear structure
- ✅ README.md as comprehensive entry point
- ✅ MULTITASK_GUIDE.md for advanced users
- ✅ CHANGELOG.md consolidates all technical info
- ✅ Clear comparison table for approaches
- ✅ Documentation navigation guide in README
- ✅ FILES_GUIDE.md maps every file to its purpose

---

## Validation

### Recommended Checks

1. **Read README.md** - Verify it makes sense
2. **Test links** - Ensure all internal links work
3. **Review MULTITASK_GUIDE.md** - Verify accuracy of arguments
4. **Check CHANGELOG.md** - Ensure no critical info lost
5. **Review FILES_GUIDE.md** - Verify file descriptions accurate

### Quick Test Commands

```bash
# Check all markdown files exist
ls -1 *.md

# Verify README links (manual check)
grep -o '\[.*\](.*\.md)' README.md

# Count documentation lines
wc -l *.md

# Check for broken references
grep -r "MULTITASK_IMPROVEMENTS" *.md  # Should only be in CHANGELOG
```

### When Refactoring Code

1. Update FILES_GUIDE.md if file purposes change
2. Update architecture diagrams in SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md if needed
3. Update IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md if design decisions change

## Conclusion

The documentation refactoring is complete! The repository now has:

✅ **Clear structure** - 10 core docs vs. 22 scattered files
✅ **Comprehensive coverage** - All three approaches documented
✅ **Easy navigation** - README guides users to right docs
✅ **Consolidated knowledge** - Technical fixes in one place
✅ **Better maintenance** - Easier to keep up-to-date

**Recommended next action**: Archive or delete the 15 consolidated technical markdown files to reduce clutter.
