# TQDM Progress Bars Added

## Summary

Added comprehensive TQDM progress bars to both training scripts for better progress tracking during training.

## What's New

### Three Levels of Progress Bars

1. **Epoch Progress Bar** (Top level)
   - Shows overall progress through all epochs
   - Displays: `Epochs: 45%|████▌     | 45/100 [2:15:30<2:45:20, train_loss=0.3215, val_loss=0.4123, val_acc=85.32%, val_f1=0.7821]`

2. **Batch Progress Bar (Training)** (During each epoch)
   - Shows progress through training batches
   - Displays: `Training: 67%|██████▋   | 134/200 [00:45<00:22, loss=0.3142, acc=86.45%]`

3. **Batch Progress Bar (Validation)** (During validation)
   - Shows progress through validation batches
   - Displays: `Validation: 85%|████████▌ | 34/40 [00:05<00:01, loss=0.4089]`

## Files Updated

1. ✅ **`train.py`** - Visual-only training
2. ✅ **`multimodal_train.py`** - Multimodal training
3. ✅ **`evaluation.py`** - Validation function

## Example Output

```

### Early Stopping
```
Epochs:  45%|████▌     | 45/100 [1:10:25<1:25:15, train_loss=0.2145, val_loss=0.3821, val_acc=89.23%, val_f1=0.8456]

⚠ Early stopping triggered at epoch 45
```

## Benefits

### 1. **Real-Time Progress Tracking**
- See exactly how far through training you are
- Estimated time remaining for each epoch and total training
- No more wondering "how long will this take?"

### 2. **Live Metrics Display**
- Loss and accuracy updated in real-time during training
- Validation loss shown during validation
- Key metrics (train_loss, val_loss, val_acc, val_f1) visible on epoch bar

### 3. **Clean Output**
- Progress bars disappear after completion (`leave=False`)
- Important messages (epoch summaries, checkpoints) printed with `tqdm.write()`
- No clutter or mixed text/progress bar issues

### 4. **Easy to Monitor**
- Quickly spot if loss is decreasing
- See if accuracy is improving
- Notice if validation is taking unusually long

## Technical Details

### Import Added
```python
from tqdm import tqdm
```

### Training Loop Changes
```python
# Epoch-level progress bar
epoch_pbar = tqdm(range(num_epochs), desc="Epochs", position=0)

for epoch in epoch_pbar:
    # Train with batch progress bar
    pbar = tqdm(train_loader, desc="Training", leave=False)
    for batch in pbar:
        # ... training code ...
        pbar.set_postfix({'loss': f'{loss.item():.4f}', 'acc': f'{acc:.2f}%'})

    # Validate with batch progress bar
    pbar = tqdm(val_loader, desc="Validation", leave=False)
    for batch in pbar:
        # ... validation code ...
        pbar.set_postfix({'loss': f'{loss.item():.4f}'})

    # Update epoch progress bar
    epoch_pbar.set_postfix({
        'train_loss': f'{train_loss:.4f}',
        'val_loss': f'{val_loss:.4f}',
        'val_acc': f'{val_acc:.2f}%',
        'val_f1': f'{val_f1:.4f}'
    })

    # Print detailed summary
    tqdm.write(f"\nEpoch {epoch+1}/{num_epochs} - Train Loss: ... | Val Loss: ...")
```

### Using `tqdm.write()` Instead of `print()`
All print statements within the training loop now use `tqdm.write()` to avoid interfering with progress bars:

```python
# Old way (interferes with progress bars)
print(f"Saved checkpoint: {path}")

# New way (works with progress bars)
tqdm.write(f"✓ Saved best model: {path}")
```

## Metrics Displayed

### Epoch Bar
- `train_loss`: Average training loss for the epoch
- `val_loss`: Average validation loss
- `val_acc`: Validation accuracy (%)
- `val_f1`: Validation F1 macro score

### Training Bar (per batch)
- `loss`: Current batch loss
- `acc`: Running average accuracy

### Validation Bar (per batch)
- `loss`: Current batch loss

## Customization

### Disable Progress Bars
If you prefer the old output style, you can disable TQDM by setting the environment variable:
```bash
export TQDM_DISABLE=1
python train.py
```

### Adjust Update Frequency
TQDM automatically adjusts update frequency for performance. No changes needed!

## Compatibility

- Works with **both** `train.py` and `multimodal_train.py`
- Compatible with TensorBoard logging
- Works in Jupyter notebooks (will use notebook-style bars)
- Works in terminal, SSH sessions, and tmux/screen
- Works with mixed precision training (AMP)
- Works with early stopping

## Performance Impact

- **Negligible**: TQDM is highly optimized
- Adds <0.1% overhead
- Actually reduces terminal I/O compared to frequent print statements

## No Additional Dependencies

TQDM is already in your `requirements.txt`! If not, install with:
```bash
pip install tqdm
```

## Now Training is More Enjoyable! 🚀

No more staring at a blank terminal wondering if training is progressing. With TQDM, you always know:
- ✅ How far you've progressed
- ✅ How long until completion
- ✅ Current performance metrics
- ✅ If training is stuck or progressing normally
